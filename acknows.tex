Hello world!

I want to thank FEUP for the fantastic conditions of labour, the people who work here and people (students like me) by promoting activities that enable the development of areas of our interest.
Dedicated to the people who wants to learn and people with a desire to teach in general. It moves the world.

Above all, I would like to thank the fantastic synergies of the Group Coordinator (VCMI) and supervisor Prof. Jaime Cardoso  as well the Institutional Coordinator of the Superior School of Health of Porto in name of Prof. Nuno Rocha and Prof. Liliana Teixeira of Polytechnic of Leria as the promoters of this interesting idea. 

I want to thank humanity or friendship, the exchange and debate of ideas that exist in the world, which somehow inspires us, gives us encouragement in the most difficult moments and decisions and, on the other hand, gives greater meaning to life, shares happiness and other important feelings with us and vice versa. The power that positive influence can have in one another's lives.
The intrinsic willpower that makes us think, research, understand, solve problems and also make us ask for help and listen.
My thanks to family, affective, academic/professional, community, financial, sports and health support in general, without you it was not the same thing.
