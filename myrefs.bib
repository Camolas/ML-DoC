@article{HongSong2017, abstract = {In this paper, a method is proposed for classification of patients with disorder of consciousness (DOC) based on the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences analysis. The patients are divided into vegetative state (VS) and minimally consciousness state (MCS). Firstly, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was applied to find the regions of interest (ROIs), and the values of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) of ROIs were calculated subsequently. Secondly, statistical analysis, including t-test and Spearman correlation analysis were used to obtain the parameters with significant difference between VS and MCS and to extract the parameters significantly correlated to Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) scores. Finally, a classifier based on support vector machine (SVM) was trained with parameters of ROIs. Results show that a 92.31% accuracy was achieved with age and gender as extra classification features, and the confidence of classification result can be used to evaluate the level of consciousness of patients.}, author = {{Hong Song} and {Qiang Li} and {Shixiong Li} and {Wei Kang} and {Jian Yang} and {Yi Yang} and {Jianghong He}}, doi = {10.1109/SmartCloud.2017.50}, journal = {2017 IEEE International Conference on Smart Cloud (SmartCloud).

abstract = {The vegetative state and other so-called disorders of consciousness present some of the most significant practical and ethical challenges in modern medicine. It is extremely difficult to assess residual cognitive function in these patients because their movements may be minimal or inconsistent, or because no cognitive output may be possible. In recent years, behavioral and neuroimaging techniques developed within the cognitive neurosciences have provided a number of new approaches for investigating these disorders, leading to significant advances in current understanding. In several cases, residual cognitive function and even conscious awareness have been demonstrated in patients who are assumed to be vegetative yet retain cognitive abilities that have evaded detection using standard clinical methods. In this article, I review these data, focusing primarily on the vegetative and minimally conscious states.},

abstract = {Patients who survive brain injuries may develop Disorders of Consciousness (DOC) such as Coma, Vegetative State (VS) or Minimally Conscious State (MCS). Unfortunately, the rate of misdiagnosis between VS and MCS due to clinical judgment is high. Therefore, diagnostic decision support systems aiming to correct any differentiation between VS and MCS are essential for the characterization of an adequate treatment and an effective prognosis. In recent decades, there has been a growing interest in the new EEG computational techniques. We have reviewed how resting-state EEG is computationally analyzed to support differential diagnosis between VS and MCS in view of applicability of these methods in clinical practice. The studies available so far have used different techniques and analyses; it is therefore hard to draw general conclusions. Studies using a discriminant analysis with a combination of various factors and reporting a cut-off are among the most interesting ones for a future clinical application.},

@article{Luaute2018,
abstract = {Objectives: After a coma, one major challenge is the detection of awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness. In some patients, the only manifestation indicative of awareness is an appropriate emotional response. Preferred music is a powerful medium to elicit emotions and autobiographical memory. Furthermore, music has been shown to improve cognitive functions both in healthy subjects and patients with neurological impairment. We hypothesized that signs of awareness could be enhanced in some patients with disorders of consciousness under appropriate emotional stimulation such as preferred music and also probably preferred odors. Methods: To investigate an objective, easily recordable marker of emotions at the patients' bedside, electrodermal activity (skin conductance level, SCL) was assessed with stimulations in auditory and olfactory modalities, notably with preferred music, neutral sound, preferred odors, and neutral odors. The study was conducted in 11 patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) and 7 healthy participants. Results: In healthy subjects, the mean amplitude of the SCL was increased during exposure to preferred music as compared to neutral sounds (respectively: 0.00037 ± 0.0004 vs. – 0.00004 ± 0.00019 $\mu$S). No significant difference between conditions was detected in patients. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that electrodermal activity could be a useful marker of emotions induced by music in healthy controls. However, it failed to show any significant difference between conditions in patients with DOC.},

@article{Altntop2021,
abstract = {The neurological status of patients in the Intensive Care Units (ICU) is determined by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Patients in coma are thought to be unaware of what is happening around them. However, many studies show that the family plays an important role in the recovery of the patient and is a great emotional resource. In this study, Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) signals were analyzed from 31 patients with low consciousness levels between GCS 3 and 8 to determine relationship between consciousness level and GSR signals as a new approach. The effect of family and nurse on unconscious patients was investigated by GSR signals recorded with a new proposed protocol. The signals were recorded during conversation and touching of the patient by the nurse and their families. According to numerical results, the level of consciousness can be separated using GSR signals. Also, it was found that family and nurse had statistically significant effects on the patient. Patients with GCS 3,4, and 5 were considered to have low level of consciousness, while patients with GCS 6,7, and 8 were considered to have high level of consciousness. According to our results, it is obtained lower GSR amplitude in low GCS (3, 4, 5) compared to high GCS (7, 8). It was concluded that these patients were aware of therapeutic affect although they were unconscious. During the classification stage of this study, the class imbalance problem, which is common in medical diagnosis, was solved using Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE), Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) and random oversampling methods. In addition, level of consciousness was classified with 92.7% success using various decision tree algorithms. Random Forest was the method which provides higher accuracy compared to all other methods. The obtained results showed that GSR signal analysis recorded in different stages gives very successful GCS score classification performance according to literature studies.},

The theoretical view shared among the investigators is that expressed emotions are founded on motivational circuits in the brain that developed early in evolutionary history to ensure the survival of individuals and their progeny. These circuits react to appetitive and aversive environmental and memorial cues, mediating appetitive and defensive reflexes that tune sensory systems and mobilize the organism for action and underly negative and positive affects. The research reviewed here assesses the reflex physiology of emotion, both autonomic and somatic, studying affects evoked in picture perception, memory imagery, and in the context of tangible reward and punishment, and using the electroencephalograph (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), explores the brain's motivational circuits that determine human emotion. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

We will focus on the effectiveness of each technique in the diagnostic classification of these patients, and the gradual trend in research from manual to computerized tracking methods. New tools have become available at clinicians' disposal to assess eye movements with high spatial and temporal fidelity. The close relationship between eye movement generation and organic dysfunction in the brain allows these tools to be applied to the assessment of severe DOC as a unique supplementary toolset. We posit that eye tracking can improve clinical diagnostic precision for DOC, a key component of assessment that often dictates the course of clinical care in DOC patients. We see the emergence of long term eye tracking studies with seamless integration of technology in the future, to improve the performance of clinical assessment in disorders of consciousness. {\textcopyright} 2014 Ting, Perez_velazquez and Cusimano.},

abstract = {Every year, millions of patients regain conscious- ness during surgery and can potentially suffer from post-traumatic disorders. We recently showed that the detection of motor activity during a median nerve stimulation from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals could be used to alert the medical staff that a patient is waking up and trying to move under general anesthesia [1], [2]. In this work, we measure the accuracy and false positive rate in detecting motor imagery of several deep learning models (EEGNet, deep convolutional network and shallow convolutional network) directly trained on filtered EEG data. We compare them with efficient non-deep approaches, namely, a linear discriminant analysis based on common spatial patterns, the minimum distance to Riemannian mean algorithm applied to covariance matrices, a logistic regression based on a tangent space projection of covariance matrices (TS+LR). The EEGNet improves significantly the classification performance comparing to other classifiers (p- value < 0.01); moreover it outperforms the best non-deep classifier (TS+LR) for 7.2% of accuracy. This approach promises to improve intraoperative awareness detection during general anesthesia.},

@inproceedings{Xu2020,
abstract = {The diagnosis of consciousness has always been a major challenge in clinical diagnosis. Resent researches prove that machine learning has a powerful ability to distinguish between minimally conscious state (MCS) and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS). What's more, convolutional neural network has made great progress in electroencephalography (EEG) analysis of other disorders. As a result, an improved 1D-convolutional neural network structure has been proposed for outcome prediction, using resting-state EEG signals from patients with disorders of consciousness. The model is established by training 690 EEG segments from 34 of MCS and 35 of UWS diagnosed by Coma Recovery Scale - Revised. The experimental results show that the accuracy, positive predictive value, specificity and sensitivity of the improved model in our research are 88.84%, 85.59%, 86.79% and 91.22%, respectively. It shows that our improved model has better performance than the model without Batch Normalization layer, as well as the model with deep graph convolutional neural network. The improved 1D-convolutional neural network model in this study can be used as an auxiliary medical method for clinical diagnosis and detection of consciousness disorders. More profoundly, it could drive the development of robust expert systems in other neurological diseases.},

@article{Liang2020,
abstract = {Objective: Constructing a framework to evaluate consciousness is an important issue in neuroscience research and clinical practice. However, there is still no systematic framework for quantifying altered consciousness along the dimensions of both level and content. This study builds a framework to differentiate the following states: coma, general anesthesia, minimally conscious state (MCS), and normal wakefulness. Methods: This study analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from frontal channels in patients with disorders of consciousness (either coma or MCS), patients under general anesthesia, and healthy participants in normal waking consciousness (NWC). Four non-linear methods - permutation entropy (PE), sample entropy (SampEn), permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC), and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) - as well as relative power (RP), extracted features from the EEG recordings. A genetic algorithm-based support vector machine (GA-SVM) classified the states of consciousness based on the extracted features. A multivariable linear regression model then built EEG indices for level and content of consciousness. Results: The PE differentiated all four states of consciousness (p<0.001). Altered contents of consciousness for NWC, MCS, coma, and general anesthesia were best differentiated by the SampEn, and PLZC. In contrast, the levels of consciousness for these four states were best differentiated by RP of Gamma and PE. A multi-dimensional index, combined with the GA-SVM, showed that the integration of PE, PLZC, SampEn, and DFA had the highest classification accuracy (92.3%). The GA-SVM was better than random forest and neural networks at differentiating these four states. The 'coordinate value' in the dimensions of level and content were constructed by the multivariable linear regression model and the non-linear measures PE, PLZC, SampEn, and DFA. Conclusions: Multi-dimensional measurements, especially the PE, SampEn, PLZC, and DFA, when combined with GA-SVM, are promising methods for constructing a framework to quantify consciousness.},

abstract = {The management of prolonged disorders of consciousness (PDOC) such as vegetative state (VS) is a major clinical challenge. Presently there are no validated prognostic markers for emergence from VS apart from age, aetiology and time spent in VS. This study explores whether or not the behavioural observation component of the SMART assessment can detect the potential for later emergence from VS. For this retrospective study 14 patients were selected who were originally assessed by the SMART as being in VS. Clinical records showed that seven of these patients have since emerged from VS (Group 1) and the other half have remained in VS (Group 2). The number, type and frequency of behaviours observed during the first five and the last five sessions of the SMART assessment were compared between the groups. The results suggest that the patients who emerged exhibited a significantly higher number of different behaviour types than those who remained in VS (p =.045). Finding an accurate predictor of prognosis for emergence from VS would assist in optimising the treatment and cost-effective management of this population in the future. Since this is a small sample the results should be reviewed with some caution but they suggest that the patients who later emerge from VS can be differentiated behaviourally from those who remain in VS.},

abstract = {In this paper, a biographical overview of Alan Turing, the 20th century mathematician, philosopher and early computer scientist, is presented. Turing has a rightful claim to the title of ‘Father of modern computing'. He laid the theoretical groundwork for a universal machine that models a computer in its most general form before World War II. During the war, Turing was instrumental in developing and influencing practical computing devices that have been said to have shortened the war by up to two years by decoding encrypted enemy messages that were generally believed to be unbreakable. After the war, he was involved with the design and programming of early computers. He also wrote foundational papers in the areas of what are now known as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and mathematical biology shortly before his untimely death. The paper also considers Turing's subsequent influence, both scientifically and culturally.},

@article{Spalding1981,
abstract = {The following argument is presented:. The actual achievements of computational fluid mechanics, great though they are, scarcely measure up to the power of the numerical schemes and of the computers that are now available. In practice, the time and energies of would-be users of computational schemes are often spent on the devising and maintaining of the computer programs which embody these schemes; and these programs, being vulnerable to damage arising from well-meant alterations, seldom perform well for long periods, once they have left their originators' hands. Progress in the application of numerical models, and in the refinement of the physical models, and in the refinement of the physical hypotheses which they embody, could be greatly accelerated if practitioners were enabled to employ a reliable and economical standard computer program, incorporating the well-established balance laws of fluid mechanics, heat transfer and mass transfer, and structured so that particular material properties, geometries and boundary conditions could be easily incorporated. Such a program, if continuously and centrally maintained, could free the computer-modelling fraternity of the chores of code construction and maintenance; it would thus permit them to apply their innovative talents to the development and application of improved physical hypotheses. The PHOENICS code system has been developed in order to meet this need. Its nature, current capabilities and development possibilities will be described in the paper. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

@article{Silver2017,
abstract = {A long-standing goal of artificial intelligence is an algorithm that learns, tabula rasa, superhuman proficiency in challenging domains. Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100–0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo. Starting from zero knowledge and without human data, AlphaGo Zero was able to teach itself to play Go and to develop novel strategies that provide new insights into the oldest of games. To beat world champions at the game of Go, the computer program AlphaGo has relied largely on supervised learning from millions of human expert moves. David Silver and colleagues have now produced a system called AlphaGo Zero, which is based purely on reinforcement learning and learns solely from self-play. Starting from random moves, it can reach superhuman level in just a couple of days of training and five million games of self-play, and can now beat all previous versions of AlphaGo. Because the machine independently discovers the same fundamental principles of the game that took humans millennia to conceptualize, the work suggests that such principles have some universal character, beyond human bias.},

@article{Liang2020,
abstract = {Objective: Constructing a framework to evaluate consciousness is an important issue in neuroscience research and clinical practice. However, there is still no systematic framework for quantifying altered consciousness along the dimensions of both level and content. This study builds a framework to differentiate the following states: coma, general anesthesia, minimally conscious state (MCS), and normal wakefulness. Methods: This study analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from frontal channels in patients with disorders of consciousness (either coma or MCS), patients under general anesthesia, and healthy participants in normal waking consciousness (NWC). Four non-linear methods - permutation entropy (PE), sample entropy (SampEn), permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC), and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) - as well as relative power (RP), extracted features from the EEG recordings. A genetic algorithm-based support vector machine (GA-SVM) classified the states of consciousness based on the extracted features. A multivariable linear regression model then built EEG indices for level and content of consciousness. Results: The PE differentiated all four states of consciousness (p<0.001). Altered contents of consciousness for NWC, MCS, coma, and general anesthesia were best differentiated by the SampEn, and PLZC. In contrast, the levels of consciousness for these four states were best differentiated by RP of Gamma and PE. A multi-dimensional index, combined with the GA-SVM, showed that the integration of PE, PLZC, SampEn, and DFA had the highest classification accuracy (92.3%). The GA-SVM was better than random forest and neural networks at differentiating these four states. The 'coordinate value' in the dimensions of level and content were constructed by the multivariable linear regression model and the non-linear measures PE, PLZC, SampEn, and DFA. Conclusions: Multi-dimensional measurements, especially the PE, SampEn, PLZC, and DFA, when combined with GA-SVM, are promising methods for constructing a framework to quantify consciousness.},

@article{Zheng2016,
abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that disorders of consciousness (DOC) after severe brain injury may result from disconnections of the thalamo-cortical system. However, thalamo-cortical connectivity differences between vegetative state (VS), minimally conscious state minus (MCS2, i.e., low-level behavior such as visual pursuit), and minimally conscious state plus (MCS1, i.e., high-level behavior such as language processing) remain unclear. Probabilistic tractography in a sample of 25 DOC patients was employed to assess whether structural connectivity in various thalamo-cortical circuits could differentiate between VS, MCS2, and MCS1 patients. First, the thalamus was individually segmented into seven clusters based on patterns of cortical connectivity and tested for univariate differences across groups. Second, reconstructed whole-brain thalamic tracks were used as features in a multivariate searchlight analysis to identify regions along the tracks that were most informative in distinguishing among groups. At the univariate level, it was found that VS patients displayed reduced connectivity in most thalamo-cortical circuits of interest, including frontal, temporal, and sensorimotor connections, as compared with MCS1, but showed more pulvinar-occipital connections when compared with MCS2. Moreover, MCS2 exhibited significantly less thalamo-premotor and thalamo-temporal connectivity than MCS1. At the multivariate level, it was found that thalamic tracks reaching frontal, parietal, and sensorimotor regions, could discriminate, up to 100% accuracy, across each pairwise group comparison. Together, these findings highlight the role of thalamo-cortical connections in patients' behavioral profile and level of consciousness. Diffusion tensor imaging combined with machine learning algorithms could thus potentially facilitate diagnostic distinctions in DOC and shed light on the neural correlates of consciousness.

abstract = {Background
The continuation of life-sustaining therapy in critical care patients with anoxic-ischemic disorders of consciousness (AI-DOC) depends on prognostic tests such as serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) concentration levels.
Objectives
To apply predictive models using machine learning methods to examine, one year after onset, the prognostic power of serial measurements of NSE in patients with AI-DOC. To compare the discriminative accuracy of this method to both standard single-day, absolute, and difference-between-days, relative NSE levels.
Methods
Classification algorithms were implemented and K-nearest neighbours (KNN) imputation was used to avoid complete case elimination of patients with missing NSE values. Non-imputed measurements from Day 0 to Day 6 were used for single day and difference-between-days.
Results
The naive Bayes classifier on imputed serial NSE measurements returned an AUC of (0.81±0.07) for n=126 patients (100 poor outcome). This was greater than logistic regression (0.73±0.08) and all other classifiers. Naive Bayes gave a specificity and sensitivity of 96% and 49%, respectively, for an (uncalibrated) probability decision threshold of 90%. The maximum AUC for a single day was Day 3 (0.75) for a subset of n=79 (61 poor outcome) patients, and for differences between Day 1 and Day 4 (0.81) for a subset of n=46 (39 poor outcome) patients.
Conclusion
Imputation avoided the elimination of patients with missing data and naive Bayes outperformed all other classifiers. Machine learning algorithms could detect automatically discriminatory features and the overall predictive power increased from standard methods due to the larger data set.

Main outcomes and results: The intra-observer intra class correlation (ICC) was 0.97 and inter-observer ICC was 0.96, implying very little within and between observer scoring variations. A modest, although significant correlation was established between SMART and either physician or WNSSP scores. However, the correlation between the WNSSP and SMART was higher (r = 0.70) than that between WNSSP and physicians scores (r = 0.451) or between SMART and physicians (r = 0.474).

abstract = {The management of prolonged disorders of consciousness (PDOC) such as vegetative state (VS) is a major clinical challenge. Presently there are no validated prognostic markers for emergence from VS apart from age, aetiology and time spent in VS. This study explores whether or not the behavioural observation component of the SMART assessment can detect the potential for later emergence from VS. For this retrospective study 14 patients were selected who were originally assessed by the SMART as being in VS. Clinical records showed that seven of these patients have since emerged from VS (Group 1) and the other half have remained in VS (Group 2). The number, type and frequency of behaviours observed during the first five and the last five sessions of the SMART assessment were compared between the groups. The results suggest that the patients who emerged exhibited a significantly higher number of different behaviour types than those who remained in VS (p =.045). Finding an accurate predictor of prognosis for emergence from VS would assist in optimising the treatment and cost-effective management of this population in the future. Since this is a small sample the results should be reviewed with some caution but they suggest that the patients who later emerge from VS can be differentiated behaviourally from those who remain in VS.},
