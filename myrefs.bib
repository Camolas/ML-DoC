abstract = {The vegetative state and other so-called disorders of consciousness present some of the most significant practical and ethical challenges in modern medicine. It is extremely difficult to assess residual cognitive function in these patients because their movements may be minimal or inconsistent, or because no cognitive output may be possible. In recent years, behavioral and neuroimaging techniques developed within the cognitive neurosciences have provided a number of new approaches for investigating these disorders, leading to significant advances in current understanding. In several cases, residual cognitive function and even conscious awareness have been demonstrated in patients who are assumed to be vegetative yet retain cognitive abilities that have evaded detection using standard clinical methods. In this article, I review these data, focusing primarily on the vegetative and minimally conscious states.},

abstract = {Patients who survive brain injuries may develop Disorders of Consciousness (DOC) such as Coma, Vegetative State (VS) or Minimally Conscious State (MCS). Unfortunately, the rate of misdiagnosis between VS and MCS due to clinical judgment is high. Therefore, diagnostic decision support systems aiming to correct any differentiation between VS and MCS are essential for the characterization of an adequate treatment and an effective prognosis. In recent decades, there has been a growing interest in the new EEG computational techniques. We have reviewed how resting-state EEG is computationally analyzed to support differential diagnosis between VS and MCS in view of applicability of these methods in clinical practice. The studies available so far have used different techniques and analyses; it is therefore hard to draw general conclusions. Studies using a discriminant analysis with a combination of various factors and reporting a cut-off are among the most interesting ones for a future clinical application.},

@article{Luaute2018,
abstract = {Objectives: After a coma, one major challenge is the detection of awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness. In some patients, the only manifestation indicative of awareness is an appropriate emotional response. Preferred music is a powerful medium to elicit emotions and autobiographical memory. Furthermore, music has been shown to improve cognitive functions both in healthy subjects and patients with neurological impairment. We hypothesized that signs of awareness could be enhanced in some patients with disorders of consciousness under appropriate emotional stimulation such as preferred music and also probably preferred odors. Methods: To investigate an objective, easily recordable marker of emotions at the patients' bedside, electrodermal activity (skin conductance level, SCL) was assessed with stimulations in auditory and olfactory modalities, notably with preferred music, neutral sound, preferred odors, and neutral odors. The study was conducted in 11 patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) and 7 healthy participants. Results: In healthy subjects, the mean amplitude of the SCL was increased during exposure to preferred music as compared to neutral sounds (respectively: 0.00037 ± 0.0004 vs. – 0.00004 ± 0.00019 $\mu$S). No significant difference between conditions was detected in patients. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that electrodermal activity could be a useful marker of emotions induced by music in healthy controls. However, it failed to show any significant difference between conditions in patients with DOC.},

@article{Altntop2021,
abstract = {The neurological status of patients in the Intensive Care Units (ICU) is determined by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Patients in coma are thought to be unaware of what is happening around them. However, many studies show that the family plays an important role in the recovery of the patient and is a great emotional resource. In this study, Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) signals were analyzed from 31 patients with low consciousness levels between GCS 3 and 8 to determine relationship between consciousness level and GSR signals as a new approach. The effect of family and nurse on unconscious patients was investigated by GSR signals recorded with a new proposed protocol. The signals were recorded during conversation and touching of the patient by the nurse and their families. According to numerical results, the level of consciousness can be separated using GSR signals. Also, it was found that family and nurse had statistically significant effects on the patient. Patients with GCS 3,4, and 5 were considered to have low level of consciousness, while patients with GCS 6,7, and 8 were considered to have high level of consciousness. According to our results, it is obtained lower GSR amplitude in low GCS (3, 4, 5) compared to high GCS (7, 8). It was concluded that these patients were aware of therapeutic affect although they were unconscious. During the classification stage of this study, the class imbalance problem, which is common in medical diagnosis, was solved using Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE), Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) and random oversampling methods. In addition, level of consciousness was classified with 92.7% success using various decision tree algorithms. Random Forest was the method which provides higher accuracy compared to all other methods. The obtained results showed that GSR signal analysis recorded in different stages gives very successful GCS score classification performance according to literature studies.},

The theoretical view shared among the investigators is that expressed emotions are founded on motivational circuits in the brain that developed early in evolutionary history to ensure the survival of individuals and their progeny. These circuits react to appetitive and aversive environmental and memorial cues, mediating appetitive and defensive reflexes that tune sensory systems and mobilize the organism for action and underly negative and positive affects. The research reviewed here assesses the reflex physiology of emotion, both autonomic and somatic, studying affects evoked in picture perception, memory imagery, and in the context of tangible reward and punishment, and using the electroencephalograph (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), explores the brain's motivational circuits that determine human emotion. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

We will focus on the effectiveness of each technique in the diagnostic classification of these patients, and the gradual trend in research from manual to computerized tracking methods. New tools have become available at clinicians' disposal to assess eye movements with high spatial and temporal fidelity. The close relationship between eye movement generation and organic dysfunction in the brain allows these tools to be applied to the assessment of severe DOC as a unique supplementary toolset. We posit that eye tracking can improve clinical diagnostic precision for DOC, a key component of assessment that often dictates the course of clinical care in DOC patients. We see the emergence of long term eye tracking studies with seamless integration of technology in the future, to improve the performance of clinical assessment in disorders of consciousness. {\textcopyright} 2014 Ting, Perez_velazquez and Cusimano.},

abstract = {Every year, millions of patients regain conscious- ness during surgery and can potentially suffer from post-traumatic disorders. We recently showed that the detection of motor activity during a median nerve stimulation from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals could be used to alert the medical staff that a patient is waking up and trying to move under general anesthesia [1], [2]. In this work, we measure the accuracy and false positive rate in detecting motor imagery of several deep learning models (EEGNet, deep convolutional network and shallow convolutional network) directly trained on filtered EEG data. We compare them with efficient non-deep approaches, namely, a linear discriminant analysis based on common spatial patterns, the minimum distance to Riemannian mean algorithm applied to covariance matrices, a logistic regression based on a tangent space projection of covariance matrices (TS+LR). The EEGNet improves significantly the classification performance comparing to other classifiers (p- value < 0.01); moreover it outperforms the best non-deep classifier (TS+LR) for 7.2% of accuracy. This approach promises to improve intraoperative awareness detection during general anesthesia.},

@inproceedings{Xu2020,
abstract = {The diagnosis of consciousness has always been a major challenge in clinical diagnosis. Resent researches prove that machine learning has a powerful ability to distinguish between minimally conscious state (MCS) and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS). What's more, convolutional neural network has made great progress in electroencephalography (EEG) analysis of other disorders. As a result, an improved 1D-convolutional neural network structure has been proposed for outcome prediction, using resting-state EEG signals from patients with disorders of consciousness. The model is established by training 690 EEG segments from 34 of MCS and 35 of UWS diagnosed by Coma Recovery Scale - Revised. The experimental results show that the accuracy, positive predictive value, specificity and sensitivity of the improved model in our research are 88.84%, 85.59%, 86.79% and 91.22%, respectively. It shows that our improved model has better performance than the model without Batch Normalization layer, as well as the model with deep graph convolutional neural network. The improved 1D-convolutional neural network model in this study can be used as an auxiliary medical method for clinical diagnosis and detection of consciousness disorders. More profoundly, it could drive the development of robust expert systems in other neurological diseases.},

@article{Liang2020,
abstract = {Objective: Constructing a framework to evaluate consciousness is an important issue in neuroscience research and clinical practice. However, there is still no systematic framework for quantifying altered consciousness along the dimensions of both level and content. This study builds a framework to differentiate the following states: coma, general anesthesia, minimally conscious state (MCS), and normal wakefulness. Methods: This study analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from frontal channels in patients with disorders of consciousness (either coma or MCS), patients under general anesthesia, and healthy participants in normal waking consciousness (NWC). Four non-linear methods - permutation entropy (PE), sample entropy (SampEn), permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC), and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) - as well as relative power (RP), extracted features from the EEG recordings. A genetic algorithm-based support vector machine (GA-SVM) classified the states of consciousness based on the extracted features. A multivariable linear regression model then built EEG indices for level and content of consciousness. Results: The PE differentiated all four states of consciousness (p<0.001). Altered contents of consciousness for NWC, MCS, coma, and general anesthesia were best differentiated by the SampEn, and PLZC. In contrast, the levels of consciousness for these four states were best differentiated by RP of Gamma and PE. A multi-dimensional index, combined with the GA-SVM, showed that the integration of PE, PLZC, SampEn, and DFA had the highest classification accuracy (92.3%). The GA-SVM was better than random forest and neural networks at differentiating these four states. The 'coordinate value' in the dimensions of level and content were constructed by the multivariable linear regression model and the non-linear measures PE, PLZC, SampEn, and DFA. Conclusions: Multi-dimensional measurements, especially the PE, SampEn, PLZC, and DFA, when combined with GA-SVM, are promising methods for constructing a framework to quantify consciousness.},

abstract = {The management of prolonged disorders of consciousness (PDOC) such as vegetative state (VS) is a major clinical challenge. Presently there are no validated prognostic markers for emergence from VS apart from age, aetiology and time spent in VS. This study explores whether or not the behavioural observation component of the SMART assessment can detect the potential for later emergence from VS. For this retrospective study 14 patients were selected who were originally assessed by the SMART as being in VS. Clinical records showed that seven of these patients have since emerged from VS (Group 1) and the other half have remained in VS (Group 2). The number, type and frequency of behaviours observed during the first five and the last five sessions of the SMART assessment were compared between the groups. The results suggest that the patients who emerged exhibited a significantly higher number of different behaviour types than those who remained in VS (p =.045). Finding an accurate predictor of prognosis for emergence from VS would assist in optimising the treatment and cost-effective management of this population in the future. Since this is a small sample the results should be reviewed with some caution but they suggest that the patients who later emerge from VS can be differentiated behaviourally from those who remain in VS.},
