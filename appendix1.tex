\hspace{0.5cm}Coma:
from the Greek k√¥ma = deep sleep, can be defined as a state of total or partial loss of consciousness, voluntary motor skills and sensitivity, generally due to brain damage, intoxications, metabolic and endocrine problems, without which, regardless of severity, vital functions are maintained to a greater or lesser degree (1). When physiological, the state of coma can be measured using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCSl) and when pharmacological using the Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS).
